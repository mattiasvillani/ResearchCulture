From [Research Impact](https://researchimpactacademy.com/blog/impact-culture/) 

- **Leadership Support**: Commitment from the top-level management in promoting research and its utility in decision-making is crucial for establishing a research impact culture. <br>
MV: When teaching takes up a large portion of the department's work, it is important to promote and encourage research as well. This can be done by the head of department, but also by the dean of the faculty.
Diffuculty: professors need time to do and manage research, but should not be isolated from (undergraduate) teaching since research culture also needs to be built from the bottom up. A research-aware teaching from undergraduate level can bring forward more research focused students at later levels.

- **Clear Objectives**: Clearly stated research objectives that align with the organisationâ€™s mission and vision can foster a research-friendly environment.<br>
MV: A big picture of 'where are we going, what problems are aiming to solve or contributing to, and why' is important, particularly within a research group, but also on the department level. This needs to be balanced so that individuals are completely free to pursue their own research interests. But long term goals and visions can help to bring together different research groups and individuals.

- **Training and Development**: Regular training and development programs to enhance researchers translation skills can support the establishment of a research impact culture.<br>
MV: participation in both larger conferences, but also smaller workshops or even summer/winter schools can be important to learn new skills and to get new ideas. Should be encouraged and supported by the department, for example during annual medarbetarsamtal. Particularly important to find events that less research active staff can attend to learn about the research front, to get new ideas, motivated and ways to contribute to research. Funding from faculty funds, similar to Black box, but maybe even more focused annual calls specifically targeted at this.<br>
Reading group and Journal clubs, not only with PhD students, but also with teaching staff.

- **Collaboration**: Encouraging cross disciplinary and external collaborations can foster a stronger emphasis on research with meaning beyond academia.<br>
MV: ways to involve teaching staff in research groups, both at the department, but also at other departments. Spending a day a week at another department is both beneficial for getting into a research group where one can contribute special cross-disciplinary competence that may be lacking at another department, but also gives the visiting lecturer a clear separation from the teaching at the department for some time every week. May be easier to re-activate research as special competence within another research area. Publications early by tapping in to an existing project. LiU: Oleg at medical faculty, Linda at Psychology, Bertil at neuroimaging. Consulting centers directed to other faculty can be useful for getting into contact with other departments (Statistics is obvious, but Economics, Law, Linguistics are other examples).

- **Resource Allocation**: Providing sufficient resources, both in terms of finance and time, to conduct, disseminate, and implement research findings is important.

- **Incentives and Rewards**: Recognising and rewarding staff who contribute to research translation efforts can reinforce a culture of research impact.

- **Policy and Procedures**: Establishing clear policies and procedures around how we conduct and translate research can help embed a research culture.

- **Communicating Impact**: Regularly communicating the impact and benefits of past organisational research to all staff members can help them understand the value and importance of research beyond the institution.<br>
MV: build a culture where success stories are inspiring and not intimidating. Celebrate success, but also failures (funding success and failures, but hard to keep the balance. Best if failures turned into success by reformulating/refocusing grant application).

- **Hiring and Promotion Policies**: Hiring and promoting individuals who value research translation and its impact can strengthen a research culture.<br>
MV: how to give more weight to open and sharing researchers in the hiring process. Network and collaboration skills. Perhaps own reflection on how the person has contributed to the research environment here would be very useful?

- **Technological Infrastructure**: Implementing the necessary technology and digital tools can facilitate research activities and support the capture and communication of their impact.<br>
MV: Keep staff updated on Computing on clusters, productivity tools such as word processors like Overleaf, code editors like VS Code, specialized software, bibliography tools like Google Scholar etc, AI tools like chatGPT. Information sharing so that not everyone re-invents the wheel. TechTalks. 

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Encouraging a culture of knowledge sharing can help propagate research findings and their implications throughout more broadly.<br>
Publication culture. PhD students, but also less junior researchers. What are appropriate journals. Emails, or internal web posts, about publications with the intent of celebrating successes as a DEPARTMENT, but mainly to inform about the research AND the journal process (submitted there and rejected, did this an resubmitted and got accepted etc). Book chapters at different publishers. Predatory journals. Ranking of journals matter, don't sell yourself short as junior researcher. But can be harmful to focus too much on ranking. Top three mentality. Even senior people can learn about new outlets. Journal/Conference balance can swing over time.

- **Mentorship Programs**: Establishing mentorship programs where researchers with impact experience guide and support less experienced staff to foster an impactful research environment.<br>
Clearly important for PhD students, but also for less research active staff. Mentor for research applications. Team up junior applicant with a senior research who gives feedback.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Regular feedback on research translation activities and their outcomes can help in refining processes and improving research impact over time.

- **Risk Management**: Cultivating an environment where risks are managed rather than avoided can encourage innovative research and translation.<br>
MV: Risk taking is important, but also to be aware of the risks. Risk management is important, but should not be a hindrance to research. Plan A and Plan B thinking. Ambitious projects, but with potential for publishable results even if the main goal is not reached.

Research seminars. Getting high profile researchers to visit, and stay for some days. This give a boost to the research culture, but also to the research itself. PhD students and teaching staff, should be encouraged to plan discussions with top researchers. Need some money for this, but also time for the host. 100.000 per semester could be good investment.

Guest professors for longer visits. Give a PhD course, seminar and interact with the staff. Funding?

Getting more junior researchers to present their work without fear of being harshly judged. The barrier to present should be low, but the seminar should be carefully prepared and need not be long. Brown bag?

Within research groups: what are you currently working on? But also at the department level, across groups. 10 minute presentation of current research topic. Leads to chats at the coffee machine.

Problem of disclosing research ideas too early, particularly in the international area in which researchers operate. This is both early ideas seminars, but also ideas for research grants. Does not mean pure plagarism, but its hard to unsee an idea once you have seen it. 

**The big question**: how to get people to initiate research discussions in the corridor, and not just practical teaching issues? Live and breath research. Time is the enemy.


Funding. How to find time to write research proposals for active researchers. But even more so for inactive ones. Much harder to write an application when you have been out of research for some years. How reactivate old ideas, but also how to know when to drop an old idea that is no longer of much interest in the community. Mentors can help a lot here, by discouraging bad ideas, but also point in new directions.

Meeting where funders are presented. 
Meetings where successful applications are presented. 
Meetings where junior staff pitch ideas for project proposals and get feedback from seniors on the idea and how to successfully present the idea to funders.

Sending PhD students and staff away for to visit other universities (both national and internationally) to get away from teaching, be inspired and learn new things, get new perspectives also on how to organize a departments work. Funding is available for PhD students. But also for staff? More costly to let a teacher go since he/she needs to be replaced.

Teaching-Research synergies. Master thesis projects (co)supervised by teaching staff. 

Building from the bottom. Master students in research projects course. But also needs external inflow of PhD students and staff. Need both.
