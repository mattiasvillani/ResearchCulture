## My experiences and influences

![](Images/riksbank.jpg){fig-align="center" width="61%"}&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](Images/STIMA.png){fig-align="center" width="34%"}

## The premise  

-   Many academic departments have [**heavy teaching**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.

-   [**Teaching is intense**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} and students depend on us.

-   Teaching have shorter time scales than research. [**Crowding out**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.

-   Teaching culture can quickly become dominant.
    
-   How to develop a [**research culture**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} and maintain teaching efforts?

-   OED: *a way of life or social environment characterized by or associated with the specified quality or thing*.

-   [**Naturally occurring research** **discussions at the coffee machine**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.

-   Synergistic relationship between teaching and research?

-   Is it possible to develop a culture, or must it happen organically?



## The simple solution  

-   Just increase [**research time**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} for all lecturers ...
-   Increase external funding.
-   Good research is a prerequisite for [**external funding**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.\
     
-   What should we [**prioritize**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} given a limited internal research budget?
-   How to get the wheel moving in the right direction?\
     
-   It must be a [**joint effort**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}, to improve work satisfaction for everyone.

## Increase external funding - some activities 
-   Overview seminar on funding by university administration.
-   [**Seminar on funding agencies**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} by dept researchers.
    -   each researcher presents a funding agency
    -   focus? calls? grant sizes? what projects are being funded?
-   [**Seminar with successful grant applications**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.
-   [**List of calls**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} and agencies on internal dept page.
-   [**Reminders**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} at dept meetings. Email alerts. Grant calendar.

![](Images/moneyinair3.png){fig-align="center" width="35%"}

## External funding for junior researchers  

-   Connect junior researcher to [**senior mentor for a grant proposal**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.\
     

-   [**Grant-pitching seminars**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} for feedback and a senior connection.\
     

-   [**Feedback**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} throughout the process, particularly on "the big picture".\
     

-   Plus/Minus: Mentor may end up as co-applicant.\
     

-   [**Co-applicant**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} in established research group, also in other subjects.

![](Images/mentor2.png){fig-align="center" width="35%"}

## The physical environment matters

-   Suitable offices and equipment for thinking and creating.

-   Library and database access and all of that.

-   Key physical books in smaller department library.\
         

-   [**Brainstorming rooms**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} with big display, whiteboards, comfy chairs.

-   Whiteboards in the coffee room for spontaneous discussions.\
         

-   [**New books (research monographs) on display**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} in coffee room.

-   [**Bulletin board**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} with 
    - recent conference posters by staff members
    - posters of master theses and PhD student papers.

## Research seminars

- Why?

  -   Learning about new research. 

  -   Learning about the subject, both broad and deep.

  -   [**Research trends**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} - important for less active researchers.

  -   [**Meeting other researchers**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.\
         

-   Fund the seminars

    -   Attract speakers from abroad.

    -   [**Get speakers to stay**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}  for some days.

    -   Schedule [**one-on-one meetings with speaker**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.

    -   Also with PhD students and less research active staff.

## Research seminars - make them important\
         

-   [**Make seminars visible**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} on a [public web page](https://www.ida.liu.se/research/machinelearning/seminars/){preview-link="true" style="text-align: center"}, incl past seminars.\
         

-   Link to past seminars when inviting speakers. [**Stars attract stars**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.\
         

-   When paper is available, distribute it to staff for better discussion.\
         

-   PhD course credit for acting as unofficial mini-discussant.\
         

-   [Distribute the invitation and hosting](Images/forskningsseminarier.png){preview-link="true" style="text-align: center"} across all researchers. <br>Make it the **department's** seminar series.\
         

## Get people here, send people away

-   Mobility is undervalued (in Sweden).\
          
-   Encourage [**teacher exchange programs**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}, particularly on advanced and PhD level courses. New environment, meet people, time to reflect.\
         
-   Attract [**guest professors**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} to give a course, seminars and for discussing research. Funding.\
         
-   Send PhD students abroad on a longer [**pre-doc**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} visit to top research environment. Excellent for motivation and new ideas.\
         
-   Scholarships and travel support. [URA-agreement](https://www.arbetsgivarverket.se/arbetsgivarguiden/personal-utomlands/utlandsstationering-med-ura/) is ideal, but costly.\
         
- Easy and cheap guest housing on campus would do wonders.

## Learning together - journal clubs etc

-   Reading groups to discuss current or foundational articles:
    -   Small groups in research areas, perhaps online with other uni
    -   Larger group at dept level
    -   Read a book together, each person is responsible for a chapter.\
         
-   [Tech talks](Images/techtalks.png){preview-link="true"} at Statistics, SU:
    -   Informal meeting every fourth week at 4-5 pm.
    -   Short presentations (5-60 mins) from staff.
    -   Master students also welcome.
    -   Dinner afterwards. BYO, order in, or university restaurant.\
         
-   Make junior researchers (involved) co-supervisors.<br>Small research groups.

## Research-teaching synergies

-   Education grounded in research benefits students and society, but also lecturers. Students also build research culture. Let them in.
-   Make basic courses [**research-inspiring**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.<br>Make advanced courses [**research-preparing**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.
-   Teaching teams led by professor at basic courses.\
         
-   Research-inspiring education :arrow_right: [**research-oriented master theses**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}.
-   [**Master thesis supervision**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} activates a supervisor's research nerve.
-   [**Research project course**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} with students partipating in focused research task at dept.
-   Use that second year of masters used to be first year of  PhD.
-   Invite (master) students to research seminars.

## Publication outlets

-   [**Publication record**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} main determinant for funding and positions.
-   Little time for research, important to place your research well.
-   [**Finding the right journal**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} can be hard, especially for juniors.
-   Aim too high/wrong :arrow_right: reject :arrow_right: resubmit, but aim too low.
-   [**Publication "emails"**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"}:
    -   share info about research
    -   share info about journals
    -   share info about (rejection/revision) path to publication.
    -   celebrate a colleague's success. :partying_face:
-   [Journal rankings](https://www.scimagojr.com/), but also experienced colleagues' rankings.
-   :warning: Obsessive ranking mentality can be crippling.

## Making research and researchers visible

-   Clear web page with research profiles and groups..\
         
-   [Department web page](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/villani-1.394193) for each researcher..\
         
-   [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=lyW8fWYAAAAJ&hl=sv) profile page..\
         
-   [Personal web page](https://mattiasvillani.com/) linked from department web..\
         
-   Make [course material](https://statisticssu.github.io/SDA1/) public..\
         
-   Social media and blogs can be great for networks and feedback.

## Concluding remarks

-   Developing a research culture is hard, but doable.
-   Most of staff  
-   Good research requires funding. Funding requires good research.
-   Support from management is crucial.
-   Communication is important. Tools matter. Internal and external web.
-   "Black box" money is really useful. A little money can go a long way. <br><br><br><br> I would love to hear [**your thoughts and ideas**]{style="color:#bf9d6c;"} now!
